# WorkItems Format

## 4. WorkItems Module (Aggregate Root)

WorkItems is the primary high-fidelity module. Its on-disk layout is canonical and must not be changed.

### On-Disk Layout

```
WorkItems/
  yyyy-MM-dd/
    <ticks>-<workItemId>-<revisionIndex>/
      revision.json
      [comment.json]          ← written when a comment edit/delete is detected (controlled by the Comments extension, enabled by default)
      <attachment files>
      <embedded image files>
    <ticks>-<workItemId>-c<commentId>/
      comment.json
      <embedded image files>
```

Each date folder contains a mix of **revision sub-folders** and **comment sub-folders**, all sorted chronologically by their ticks-based prefix:

- **Revision sub-folder**: `<ticks>-<workItemId>-<revisionIndex>/` — contains `revision.json` and optionally attachment binaries and embedded image files.
- **Comment sub-folder**: `<ticks>-<workItemId>-c<commentId>/` — contains `comment.json` and optionally embedded image files. The `c` prefix in `c<commentId>` distinguishes comment folders from revision folders in the same date folder. The date folder used is the comment's `createdDate` for the original comment, and the comment's `modifiedDate` for each subsequent edit version. Multiple folders may exist for the same `commentId` (one per version).

Streaming import processes revision and comment sub-folders together in lexicographic (chronological) order within each date folder.

### revision.json Required Fields

```json
{
  "workItemId": 12345,
  "revisionIndex": 17,
  "changedDate": "2026-02-25T18:12:34Z",
  "fields": [...],
  "externalLinks": [...],
  "relatedLinks": [...],
  "hyperlinks": [...],
  "attachments": [
    {
      "originalName": "screenshot.png",
      "relativePath": "638760123456789012-screenshot.png",
      "sha256": "abc123...",
      "size": 102400
    }
  ],
  "embeddedImages": [
    {
      "originalUrl": "https://dev.azure.com/org/_apis/wit/attachments/uuid",
      "relativePath": "image-abc123def456.png",
      "extension": "png",
      "sha256": "abc123...",
      "size": 51200
    }
  ]
}
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `workItemId` | integer | Work item ID in the source system |
| `revisionIndex` | integer | Zero-based revision index |
| `changedDate` | ISO 8601 string | UTC timestamp of the revision |
| `fields` | array | All field values as of this revision |
| `externalLinks` | array | External links attached to this revision |
| `relatedLinks` | array | Related work item links |
| `hyperlinks` | array | Hyperlinks |
| `attachments` | array | Attachment metadata for files in this folder |
| `embeddedImages` | array | Embedded images discovered and rewritten in field values |

### Attachment Rules

- Attachment files are stored **beside** `revision.json` in the same folder.
- There is **no global attachments module** and no mandatory blob store.
- Each attachment entry in `revision.json` includes:
  - `originalName` — the filename as it appeared in the source system
  - `relativePath` — the actual filename on disk (may be prefixed with attachment ID or SHA)
  - `sha256` — integrity hash
  - `size` — byte count

**Optional integrity improvement:** store files as `<attachmentId>-<sha256>` on disk, preserving the original filename only in metadata.

### No Global Attachments Module

Attachments are scoped to their revision. There is no `Attachments/` root folder in the package. This is a hard rule; see [.agents/guardrails/system-architecture.md](../.agents/guardrails/system-architecture.md).

### Comments and Discussions

Each comment is stored in its own sub-folder within the date folder that corresponds to the comment's `createdDate` (original) or `modifiedDate` (each edit version). This places comments chronologically alongside revision sub-folders in the same date folder, enabling streaming import to process all entries in the correct order.

**Comment sub-folder naming**: `<ticks>-<workItemId>-c<commentId>/`

- `ticks` is the .NET `DateTime.Ticks` of the comment's `createdDate` (for the original) or `modifiedDate` (for each edit version), in UTC.
- `workItemId` is the integer work item ID.
- `c<commentId>` is the comment ID prefixed with `c` to distinguish it from revision folders in the same date folder.

Each comment sub-folder contains a single file named `comment.json`.

**Multiple versions of a comment**: When a comment is edited, the original is stored at its `createdDate` ticks and each edit is a separate sub-folder at its `modifiedDate` ticks. Both folders use the same `commentId` in the name. The `version` field inside `comment.json` identifies which version the folder represents.

**Deleted comments**: Excluded from the export by default. The configuration flag `modules.workItems.extensions[Comments].parameters.includeDeleted` (boolean, default `false`) enables inclusion.

#### comment.json Schema

```json
{
  "commentId": 42,
  "version": 1,
  "text": "This is a comment",
  "format": "html|markdown",
  "renderedText": "<p>This is a comment</p>",
  "createdBy": { "id": "user-id", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
  "createdDate": "2026-02-25T18:12:34Z",
  "modifiedBy": { "id": "user-id", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
  "modifiedDate": "2026-02-25T18:12:34Z",
  "isDeleted": false,
  "embeddedImages": [
    {
      "originalUrl": "https://dev.azure.com/org/_apis/wit/attachments/uuid",
      "relativePath": "image-abc123def456.png",
      "extension": "png",
      "sha256": "abc123...",
      "size": 51200
    }
  ]
}
```
```

### Inline Comment Fetching (Feature-Gated)

When a work item revision represents a **comment edit or delete** — detected by the presence of
`System.CommentCount` in the revision's changed fields AND the absence of `System.History` — the
export orchestrator can optionally fetch the matching comment versions from the Azure DevOps
Comments API and write them as `comment.json` **inside the revision folder** (alongside `revision.json`).

This behaviour is **enabled by default** when the `Comments` extension is enabled (the default).
Disable it by setting `{ "Type": "Comments", "Enabled": false }` in the module's `Extensions` list.

**Detection logic (`IsCommentEditOrDeleteRevision`):**

- `RevisionIndex == 0` → always excluded (creation revision; all fields appear as changed).
- `System.History` present and non-empty → comment addition; no API call needed (text is already in `revision.json`).
- `System.CommentCount` present AND `System.History` absent or empty → comment edit or delete; fetch from API.

**Matching strategy:** comments are fetched for the work item, then filtered to those whose
`ModifiedDate` is within ±1 second of the revision's `ChangedDate`.

**File format:** `comment.json` inside the revision folder is a **JSON array** of
`WorkItemComment` objects (the same objects used in `c<commentId>` sub-folders), not a single
object. Multiple comments can match the same revision timestamp.

```json
[
  {
    "commentId": 42,
    "version": 2,
    "text": "Updated comment text",
    "format": "html",
    "renderedText": "<p>Updated comment text</p>",
    "createdBy": { "id": "user-id", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
    "createdDate": "2026-02-25T18:12:34Z",
    "modifiedBy": { "id": "user-id", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com" },
    "modifiedDate": "2026-02-26T10:00:00Z",
    "isDeleted": false,
    "embeddedImages": []
  }
]
```

**Error handling:** Comment API failures during inline fetching are **non-fatal**. A `ProgressEvent`
warning is emitted and the export continues. The revision folder will exist without a `comment.json`
if the API call fails.

**Known limitation:** `AzureDevOpsWorkItemCommentSource.GetCommentsAsync()` has an upstream SDK bug
(`$top` parameter out of range). Errors are non-fatal and handled as above. Full comment data will
be correctly persisted once the SDK is fixed.

**Relationship to `c<commentId>` sub-folders:** The two `comment.json` placements serve different
purposes and both may be present in the same package:

| Placement | Format | Contents | When written |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| `<rev-folder>/comment.json` | JSON array | Comments matching this revision's timestamp | Only when the Comments extension is enabled and a comment edit/delete is detected |
| `<commentId-folder>/comment.json` | JSON object | One version of one comment | Comment sub-module export (future) |

### Embedded Images

Embedded images are images referenced inline within HTML or Markdown field values (e.g. `<img src="...">` in HTML or `![](...)` in Markdown). These are a different category from attachments: they are discovered during export, downloaded from the source system, and stored locally.

#### Embedded Image Rules

1. **Discovery**: During export, field values are scanned for HTML `<img src>` tags and Markdown `![](url)` patterns.
2. **Download**: Images with URLs hosted on the source organisation are downloaded; non-ADO URLs are left as-is (and logged as warnings).
3. **Storage**: Downloaded images are stored **beside their parent document** — inside the revision folder (beside `revision.json`) for revision-field images, and inside the comment folder (beside `comment.json`) for comment images. Each downloaded image is named by the SHA-256 hash of its content with the extension inferred from the HTTP `Content-Type` response header (e.g. `abc123def456.png`). The local filename is stored in the `embeddedImages` array of the parent document.
4. **Rewriting**: Field and comment values in the JSON are rewritten to reference the local filename instead of the remote URL (e.g. `image-abc123.png` instead of `https://dev.azure.com/...`).
5. **Metadata**: Each embedded image entry is tracked in an `embeddedImages` array in the revision or comment, recording the original URL, stored filename, size, and integrity hash.

#### Embedded Image Metadata Entry

```json
{
  "originalUrl": "https://dev.azure.com/org/_apis/wit/attachments/uuid",
  "relativePath": "image-abc123def456.png",
  "extension": "png",
  "sha256": "abc123...",
  "size": 51200
}
```

## Source Interface Contract

The type serialised to `revision.json` is `WorkItemRevision`, defined in `DevOpsMigrationPlatform.Abstractions`.

### WorkItemRevision

```csharp
public record WorkItemRevision
{
    public int WorkItemId { get; init; }
    public int RevisionIndex { get; init; }
    public DateTimeOffset ChangedDate { get; init; }
    public IReadOnlyList<WorkItemField> Fields { get; init; }
    public IReadOnlyList<WorkItemLink> ExternalLinks { get; init; }
    public IReadOnlyList<WorkItemLink> RelatedLinks { get; init; }
    public IReadOnlyList<WorkItemLink> Hyperlinks { get; init; }
    public IReadOnlyList<AttachmentMetadata> Attachments { get; init; }
    public IReadOnlyList<EmbeddedImageMetadata> EmbeddedImages { get; init; }
}
```

`WorkItemField` carries `ReferenceName` (e.g. `"System.Title"`) and `Value` (string-serialised).
`WorkItemLink` carries `Rel` and `Url`.
`AttachmentMetadata` carries `OriginalName`, `RelativePath`, `Sha256`, and `Size`.
`EmbeddedImageMetadata` carries `OriginalUrl`, `RelativePath`, `Extension`, `Sha256`, and `Size`.

### IWorkItemRevisionSource

Source connectors implement `IWorkItemRevisionSource` in `DevOpsMigrationPlatform.Abstractions`:

```csharp
public interface IWorkItemRevisionSource
{
    IAsyncEnumerable<WorkItemRevision> GetRevisionsAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

The `WorkItemExportOrchestrator` depends on this interface. It calls `GetRevisionsAsync` in a
streaming `await foreach` — no connector may buffer all revisions into a list before yielding.

**The orchestrator computes the folder path** from the revision data using `BuildFolderPath`.
The source does not determine or pre-compute paths.

### Reject These Patterns

| Pattern | Why rejected |
|---------|-------------|
| `ExportAsync(IAsyncEnumerable<RevisionFolder> …)` | Bypasses the source abstraction; caller constructs paths outside the orchestrator |
| `ExportAsync(IAsyncEnumerable<WorkItemRevision> …)` | No source interface — cannot be swapped for AzureDevOps vs TFS connector |
| Serialising `RevisionFolder` as revision.json | `RevisionFolder` is a path-calculation helper only; it has no work item data |
