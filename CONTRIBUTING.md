## Contributing Guidelines

### Asking Questions or Starting Discussions

- **Use GitHub Discussions**:  
  If you have questions, ideas, or suggestions, please use the [GitHub Discussions tab](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/discussions). This helps centralise knowledge and allows the community to collaborate effectively.  
  - Browse existing discussions to see if your question or idea has already been addressed.  
  - Add comments or reactions (e.g., üëç, üëé) to relevant discussions.

- **Use the Comment/Discussion Boxes on Documentation Pages**:  
  If your topic relates to an existing feature, check the relevant [documentation page](https://nkdagility.com/) for details. Most pages include comment or discussion boxes at the bottom.  
  - Using these boxes for discussions tied to specific features helps keep the conversation contextual and accessible for others with similar questions.

### Submitting Issues

#### When to Submit an Issue
Issues should only be created for confirmed **bugs** or **feature requests**. Before creating an issue:
- **Search for Existing Issues**:  
  Check [open issues](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/issues) to avoid duplicates. Use this [query](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+) to find popular feature requests.  
  If your issue already exists:
  - Add comments with additional details or context.
  - Use reactions (e.g., üëç, üëé) to express your interest.

#### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests
- Submit **one issue per problem or feature**.
- Avoid combining multiple bugs or requests in a single issue.
- Include as much detail as possible to help others reproduce the issue:
  - Version of Azure DevOps Migration Tools
  - Source and target instance versions
  - Step-by-step reproduction instructions
  - The **Session ID** from your migration run (found in the log file).

### Submitting Pull Requests

#### Bug Fixes
- **Focus on Simplicity**: Keep changes minimal and targeted to the bug being fixed.
- **Update GitVersion.yaml**: Ensure version numbers do not collide.

#### Feature Enhancements
- Features should add or improve functionality. Clearly describe the feature and its use case in the pull request.

#### General Housekeeping
Pull requests should:
1. Be based on the **master** branch.
2. Avoid merge commits (use a linear commit history).
3. Include adequate tests:
   - Tests should fail without your changes.
   - Cover edge cases and various scenarios.
   - Maintain 100% code coverage.
4. Adhere to the coding guidelines.
5. Include clear, descriptive commit messages.

#### Coding and Git Configuration
- Follow the project's coding conventions (see [Coding Guidelines](#)).  
- Set your Git configuration to avoid line-ending issues:
  ```bash
  git config --global core.autocrlf input
  git config --global core.whitespace cr-at-eol
  ```
