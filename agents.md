# Azure DevOps Migration Platform – Agent Entry Point

This file is the mandatory starting point for any AI agent or contributor.

It connects:

- Human-readable architecture (`/docs`)
- Enforced guardrails (`/.agents/guardrails`)

If anything conflicts:
- `/.agents/guardrails/*.md` guardrails override implementation
- `/docs/*.md` define architectural intent

# 🎯 Mission

Build a deterministic, resumable, versioned migration package platform:

Source → Files → Target

Modes:
- Export
- Import
- Both

The filesystem package is the source of truth.

# 🔒 MANDATORY: Guardrails Validation

> **⛔ AGENT WARNING — READ THIS BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE**
> The `copilot-instructions.md` summary table injected into your context is a **quick reference only**.
> It does **NOT** count as compliance with this section.
> You MUST make explicit `read_file` tool calls for every file listed below.
> Proceeding without those tool calls is a violation — even if you believe you already know the rules.

**Before proceeding with ANY code changes, generic agents MUST:**

1. **Read ALL guardrail files** in `/.agents/guardrails/` — use `read_file` for each:
   - [system-architecture.md](.agents/guardrails/system-architecture.md) — Core architecture constraints
   - [workitems-rules.md](.agents/guardrails/workitems-rules.md) — WorkItems-specific rules  
   - [migration-rules.md](.agents/guardrails/migration-rules.md) — Migration behavior constraints
   - [coding-standards.md](.agents/guardrails/coding-standards.md) — SOLID principles + concrete examples
   - [testing-standards.md](.agents/guardrails/testing-standards.md) — Reqnroll + MSTest conventions
   - [module-template.md](.agents/guardrails/module-template.md) — New module requirements
   - [aspire-integration.md](.agents/guardrails/aspire-integration.md) — Aspire integration guardrails
   - [atdd-workflow.md](.agents/guardrails/atdd-workflow.md) — ATDD session lifecycle rules
   - [acceptance-test-format.md](.agents/guardrails/acceptance-test-format.md) — Gherkin format rules

2. **Read relevant context files** in `/.agents/context/`:
   - [package-format.md](.agents/context/package-format.md) — Package layout specification
   - [workitems-format.md](.agents/context/workitems-format.md) — WorkItems folder structure
   - [import-streaming.md](.agents/context/import-streaming.md) — Streaming import requirements
   - [checkpointing.md](.agents/context/checkpointing.md) — Cursor-based checkpointing
   - [artefact-store.md](.agents/context/artefact-store.md) — IArtefactStore abstraction
   - [job-contract.md](.agents/context/job-contract.md) — Job contract specification
   - [identity-and-mapping.md](.agents/context/identity-and-mapping.md) — Identity mapping service

3. **State your understanding** of which guardrails apply to the current task

4. **Explicitly reject** any approach that violates the guardrails

**Failure to complete this validation = violation. Document skipping = violation.**

## Guardrail Challenge Protocol

Guardrails exist to protect architecture — but they must not force a clearly harmful or counterproductive path. If, during implementation, an agent determines that a guardrail is producing a **worse outcome** than an alternative approach, the agent MUST:

1. **Stop immediately.** Do not silently work around the guardrail or implement a suboptimal solution.
2. **Articulate the conflict.** State which specific guardrail (by number and file) is causing the problem, and explain concretely why it leads to a negative outcome in the current context.
3. **Propose a replacement.** Offer a specific, precise rewording or amendment to the guardrail that would resolve the conflict while preserving the original architectural intent.
4. **Ask the human to decide.** Present two clear options:
   - **Option A — Change the guardrail:** adopt the proposed amendment and then implement accordingly.
   - **Option B — Keep the guardrail:** accept the current constraint and implement within it, understanding the trade-off.
5. **Wait for a decision.** Do not proceed until the human confirms which option to take.

This protocol exists because guardrails are authored by humans and may contain errors, ambiguities, or assumptions that do not hold in all contexts. Blindly following a flawed rule is not compliance — it is negligence. Equally, silently ignoring a rule is a violation. The only acceptable response to a guardrail conflict is a transparent challenge.

**A guardrail challenge is not insubordination — it is quality engineering.**

## Mandatory Compliance Review Loop

After completing any unit of work (a logical change, a file edit, a task), before marking it done:

1. **Re-read the relevant docs** — use `read_file` on any doc file referenced by the guardrails that is relevant to what was just changed. Examples:
   - CLI changes → re-read `docs/cli.md` and `.agents/context/cli-commands.md`
   - Package/export/import changes → re-read `.agents/context/package-format.md`
   - Job/agent changes → re-read `.agents/context/job-contract.md`
   - Settings/config changes → re-read `docs/configuration.md`
2. **Check each change against the docs line by line.** Ask:
   - Does the implementation match what the documentation specifies?
   - Does it add anything not documented (parameters, options, commands, behaviour)?
   - Does it omit anything the documentation requires?
3. **If any non-compliance is found**, fix it immediately and repeat from step 1.
4. **Only when the review loop finds zero violations** may the task be declared complete.

**This loop is mandatory. A task is not done until the compliance review passes with no findings.**
**A change that adds undocumented parameters, options, commands, or behaviour = non-compliant. Fix before declaring done.**

## Acceptance Test Feature Files
All Gherkin `.feature` files live under `/features`, organised by operation and module:

```
features/
  cli/            ← CLI-triggered operations (export, inventory, …)
  export/         ← Export module features
  import/         ← Import module features
  inventory/      ← Inventory module features
  platform/       ← Cross-cutting platform concerns (checkpointing, validation)
  services/       ← Shared services (identity-mapping, …)
```

If code conflicts with these, reject the change.

# 🔒 Non-Negotiable Summary

1. WorkItems layout is canonical and chronological.
2. Import must be streaming and memory-safe.
3. Resume must use cursor-based checkpointing.
4. Attachments must live beside revision.json.
5. No direct Source → Target migration.
6. Modules must be isolated.
7. All persistence goes through IArtefactStore and IStateStore.
8. Determinism is mandatory.

Detailed logic is in `/.agents/guardrails`.

---

# 🚨 Reject Conditions

Reject any proposal that:

- Breaks chronological folder ordering.
- Introduces global attachment storage.
- Requires loading all revisions into memory.
- Adds hidden state outside `Checkpoints/`.
- Couples modules directly.
- Performs live streaming migration.
- Violates coding standards.
- Adds migration execution logic to the control plane.
- References a concrete artefact store implementation inside module code.
- Sorts `EnumerateAsync` results in memory.
- Creates agent rule files under `/docs` instead of `/.agents/guardrails`.
- **Implements a custom work item export/import loop instead of using `WorkItemExportOrchestrator` and `IWorkItemRevisionSource`** (see [docs/work-item-iteration-pattern.md](docs/work-item-iteration-pattern.md)).
- **Implements custom progress tracking instead of using `ICheckpointingService` with cursor-based state in `IStateStore`** (watermark tables, in-memory dictionaries, and progress databases are forbidden).
- **Implements custom enumeration or sorting logic instead of using `IArtefactStore.EnumerateAsync()` in lexicographic order** (no in-memory result sets, no custom sorting).
- **Buffers attachments or binary data in memory instead of streaming via `IArtefactStore.WriteBinaryAsync()` or `IAttachmentBinarySource`**.
- **Invents a new abstraction for work item processing without extending an existing pattern or documenting why no existing abstraction could be reused** (motivated by rule 21 of [.agents/guardrails/system-architecture.md](.agents/guardrails/system-architecture.md)).
- Leaves any `throw new NotImplementedException()` or `throw new NotSupportedException("... not yet implemented")` in any reachable code path — ephemeral stubs are only permitted within a single session and must be replaced before the task is marked complete.
- Declares a task complete without a passing `dotnet clean && dotnet build --no-incremental`.
- Declares a task complete without all tests passing (`dotnet test`).
- Declares a task complete without running at least one scenario config (e.g. `scenarios/queue-export-ado-workitems-single-project.json`) via a `launch.json` debug profile and verifying observable output.
- Marks a spec's last task `[X]` without all items in `specs/<feature>/discrepancies.md` being `Resolved` or `N/A`.
- Closes a spec branch without reviewing and updating `analysis/pending-actions.md`.
- Declares done without updating every canonical doc named in any doc-task in `tasks.md`.

# 🧭 Development Flow

When implementing:

1. Read relevant `/docs` file.
2. Apply constraints from `/.agents/guardrails`.
3. Implement via module abstraction.
4. Add tests.
5. Update schemas if required.
6. Run `dotnet clean && dotnet build --no-incremental` — MUST pass before the task is considered complete.
7. Run `dotnet test` — ALL tests MUST pass before the task is considered complete.
8. Run at least one scenario config (e.g. `scenarios/queue-export-ado-workitems-single-project.json`) via a `.vscode/launch.json` debug profile — MUST execute without errors and produce expected output before the task is considered complete.

# Final Principle

`/docs` explains the architecture.
`/.agents/guardrails` enforces the architecture.
`agents.md` binds the two.

Preserve:
- Determinism
- Streaming
- Portability
- Clarity
